# LighthouseBnB
LighthouseBnB is a clone of AirBnB. It allows home owners to rent out their homes to people on vacation, creating an alternative to hotels and bed and breakfasts. Users can view property information, book reservations, view their reservations, and write reviews.

The purpose of this project is to design a database and use server-side JavaScript to display the information from queries to web pages. It uses complex SQL queries, database and ERD (entity relationship diagram) design to integrate the database with a Node backend.
